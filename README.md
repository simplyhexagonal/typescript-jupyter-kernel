## Install

Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab installed.

Then, install the package with:

```sh
npm install -g typescript-jupyter-kernel
```

Once npm has finished, run the following command:

```
ts-kernel install
```

You can now check if the installation succeeded:

```sh
jupyter kernelspec list

# Available kernels:
#  typescript        ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/typescript
```

## Features

**Code completion:** using the `TAB` key, driven by the official [Typescript LSP Server](https://github.com/typescript-language-server/typescript-language-server) (same used by VSCode)

**Use NPM dependencies:** simply navigate to your notebook's directory and add a `package.json` file

```sh
cd /path/to/notebook
npm init
npm install --save short-unique-id
```

**Fully written in Typescript:** the kernel is written entirely in Typescript ðŸ¦¾

**SWC Optimized:** the kernel compiles your code with [SWC](https://github.com/swc-project/swc), making it blazing fast!

**Able to render HTML:** the kernel can render HTML in the notebook

**Custom output command:** the kernel includes a handy `jupyter.out` function so your notebooks
aren't riddled with unsightly `console.log` calls

**Fully compatible:** works both in JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook

## Convenience `jupyter` functionalities

We have implemented a handy `jupyter` object containing several useful functions:

- `dom`

  This is a virtual dom (JSDOM) which allows you to build html in the notebook.

```ts

```

- `html`

  This is an alias for the included D3 Selection library which allows powerful HTML manipulation.

- `render`

  This is a function that renders the html in the notebook.

- `out`

  This is a function that prints a given string to the notebook between `<pre>` tags, useful for printing the raw output of a function or process.

- `escape`

  This is a function that escapes the given string so it can be safely printed in the notebook.

- `data`

  This is an alias for the included D3 DSV library which allows to read data from/to CSV, TSV or JSON files/strings.

- `table`

  This is a function that renders a table in the notebook from data using one of the `data` functions.

- `load`

  You can use the `load` helper to load either a `js` or `css` file into the notebook.
